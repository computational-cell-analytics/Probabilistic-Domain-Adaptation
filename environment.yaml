    # Note: installing the pytorch package from conda-forge will generally
    # give you the most optmized version for your system, if you have a modern
    # enough OS and CUDA version (CUDA >= 12). For older versions, you can
    # specify the CUDA version by pinning libtorch.
    # For example, add this line for a CUDA 11 version:
    # - libtorch=*=cuda11*
    # or, to enforce a CPU installation, change to
    # - "pytorch=*=cpu*"
